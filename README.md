The CEVIGS pfp-automation tools allows you to automatically set your profile picture every day to counter the force of the default KEGS pfp.

This works by downloading the chrome browser and opening it every morning automatically on the github server.

This means that the code does **not run on your device** and will run **automatically, even if your device(s) are off**.

Use at your own risk!
